# TODO(b.kelemen): we can get rid of this and just rename gyp_trunk.py to
# gyp_trunk and make it executable once all bots and the like switched to
# use gyp_trunk. In the transition period it has to have the .py suffix
# to make it possible to import it from gyp_chromium.
# Executable with .py suffix feels lame.
